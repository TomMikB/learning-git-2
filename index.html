		<h2>Guns N' Roses - You Could Be Mine</h2>
		<p>
			I'm a cold heartbreaker
			Fit ta burn and I'll rip your heart in two
			An I'll leave you lyin' on the bed
			I'll be out the door before ya wake
			It's nuthin' new ta you
			'Cause I think *we've seen that movie too
			<br>
			'Cause you could be mine
			But you're way out of line
			With your bitch slap rappin'
			And your cocaine tongue
			You get nuthin' done
			I said you could be mine
			<br>
			Now holidays come and then they go
			It's nothin' new today
			Collect another memory
			When I come home late at night
			Don't ask me where I've been
			Just count your stars I'm home again
			<br>
			'Cause you could be mine
			But you're way out of line
			With your bitch slap rappin'
			And your cocaine tongue
			You get nuthin' done
			I said you could be mine
			<br>
			You've gone sketchin' too many times
			Why don't ya give it a rest
			Why
			Must you find
			Another reason to cry
			<br>
			While you're breakin' down my back n'
			I been rackin' out my brain
			It don't matter how we make it
			'Cause it always ends the same
			You can push it for more mileage
			But your flaps r' wearin' thin
			And I could sleep on it 'til mornin'
			But this nightmare never ends
			Don't forget to call my lawyers
			With ridiculous demands
			An you can take the pity so far
			But it's more than I can stand
			'Cause this couchtrip's gettin' older
			Tell me how long has it been
			'Cause 5 years is forever
			An you haven't grown up yet
			<br>
			You could be mine
			But you're way out of line
			With your bitch slap rappin'
			And your cocaine tongue
			You get nuthin' done
			I said you could be
			You should be
			You could be mine
			<br>
			Yeah!
